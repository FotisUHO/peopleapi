A solution for people

Task 2 : There is a second controller to serve a second endpoint which has more complicated search queries.
Usually, for query search modern Spring REST, modern libraries to provide filter/search which make flexible queries and make the search much more specific on the 
exact resources needed. Libraries like Specification and Predicate, are very strong and simple to implement. However, I choose to keep this simple since this is a
coding task.
